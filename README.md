Axure RP is the industry leading tool for user experience professionals to communicate their ideas to colleagues and clients. It helps you create design “views” or variations for your projects that are fit for different screen sizes.

In this course you will learn how to create files and design patterns that you can use for all your responsive projects. Then you will customize what you’ve created to build an online bookshop for multiple devices.

In this extended edition, learn the basics of prototyping with Axure before moving onto advanced features like Adaptive Views and the Repeater widget.

You will learn the techniques to manage the design process optimally for everyone, from a one man UX freelancer to enterprise environments. You’ll have the time and expertise to take your projects further with richer, more advanced interactions. With this course you will learn how to work smarter and faster.
